    <!-- Chosen Palette: Deep Night -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a single-page interface with a fixed sidebar for navigation and a main content area for displaying SQL query categories. This structure facilitates easy browsing of different types of queries (e.g., General, Student, Teacher, Upload) and update operations. Each query is presented in a collapsible card, allowing users to focus on one query at a time and reveal its details as needed. This design prioritizes content organization, scannability, and on-demand information retrieval, making it intuitive for users to explore and understand the various SQL operations across different devices. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: SQL queries for database operations. -> Goal: Provide an interactive and easily digestible reference for SQL queries. -> Viz/Presentation Method: Textual content (query descriptions and SQL code) is presented within collapsible "cards". -> Interaction: Navigation links filter the displayed queries by category. Each query card has a "Show Query" button to reveal the SQL code, promoting active engagement. Justification: The interactive cards enhance readability and prevent information overload. Categorization aids in quick lookup and understanding of related queries. The dark theme provides a sleek, elegant aesthetic. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for navigation and toggle functionality. No Chart.js or Plotly.js is used as the content is purely textual SQL queries, and visual charts would not enhance understanding in this context. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
